Step to Run the program completly:
    1)Make sure the raw images are in the "input" file
    2)Run the Makefile with the command "make"
    3)If you want to display as .png:
        3.1)Run the command "make convert"
    4)Run the command "make clean" if needed

    2) Conclusions:
        Speed Improvement: The SIMD implementation is significantly faster than the C implementation for every image processed. The performance gain is substantial, ranging from 
            approximately 1500\% to as high as 2700\% faster.

        Consistency Across Different Image Sizes: Whatever the raw file size, the SIMD implementation is always significantly faster than the C one.

        From a performance analysis standpoint, these results demonstrate the potential of SIMD optimizations to improve the speed of image processing operations.
